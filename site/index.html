            <p>I’ve worked as an English as a Second Language teacher for the past 11 years. I love teaching, but due to
                the uncertainty of working as an independent contractor,<br>I decided it was time for a change and chose
                to pursue a long-time dream to return to school for computer programming this fall. In the early 1990’s
                I bought my first computer.<br>I taught myself everything I could about the software and hardware
                including upgrading my computer myself. I’ve been the family and friends help desk for years!<br>I
                learned enough about coding html to create a personal homepage. Many years later, I created a personal
                WordPress site which I maintained for a long time.</p>
            <p>There are so many options to choose from in software development and IT, so I’m not yet certain which
                pathway I want to take. I’m sure I’ll have a better idea this time next year.<br>I’ve often considered
                computer game development because I love gaming, especially World of Warcraft, which I’ve been playing
                since 2007, but I’m also curious about cybersecurity,<br>AI and coding for robotics.</p>

                <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. Metal, rock and SKA are my preferred genres. I love
                    Linkin Park (old and new), Iron Maiden, Dio, Bad Religion to name a few.<br> World of Warcraft is my
                    long-time game of choice. No other game has captivated or kept me coming back like WoW has. Another
                    of my favorite pastimes is listening to audiobooks!<br>I’m addicted to GraphicAudio. They produce
                    dramatized versions of audiobooks that are played by a full cast. They’re fantastic! It’s a bit like
                    the old radio shows in the pre-television era.<br>It’s like a movie in your mind and brings the
                    books to life.</p>
